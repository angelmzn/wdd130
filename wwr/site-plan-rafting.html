      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hi! Welcome to White Water Rafting! We are incredibly excited to have you here. You may wonder, What do we pursue? The answer is that we want to help people experience Water Rafting in a safe environment and with all the equipment and experienced personnel that can make this an excellent experience for you, your group of friends, or your family. </p>

      <p>Water or River rafting is an excellent outdoor activity. It challenges the body and the mind, motivates teamwork and leadership, and allows groups to work and grow together, besides, the adrenaline rush you would get with us may be something you can get with other activities more dangerous or extreme. We want this to be a precious memory for you, so let us focus on safety and security, and you focus on enjoying the ride. </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>

      <p>The joy of life comes when we encounter new experiences, especially those that are filled with fun and excitement. Go to bed under a million stars and wake up to the smell of crisp fresh mountain air. Spend the day in the sun laughing with friends and family as you paddle down sensational rapids and experience all the delights and thrills of whitewater rafting.</p>

      <p>We want to introduce as many people as possible to this activity. White water rafting is a sport that novices can easily partake in. At the beginning of every white water rafting tour, the rafting guide briefs all the participants and explains what the course of events will look like. We offer tours for beginners and the more advanced so that everyone can find their ideal rafting adventure.</p>

      <p>Depending on which river or which rafting route is selected, different physical abilities are prescribed. All participants of a white water rafting tour should be in overall good health and possess a basic level of fitness, as they are always in motion. White water rafting requires people to use, in particular, their arm, upper body and leg muscles, in order to carry or steer the raft or to keep their own body in position while inside the raft. Adults who weigh more than 125kg/275lbs should let the provider know beforehand, as this can result in the maximum amount of people per raft being reduced.</p>
