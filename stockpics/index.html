            <p> The purpose of Stockpics is to provide an alternative for stock images that can be used for any situation, Business, School, Personal projects, illustrations, books, articles, videos, etc. Our objective demographic can be quite extense, therefore we strive to provide images that are current, meaningful and represent what our users want to portray through them.  </p> <br>
            <p> Our visitors can expect us to be completely focused on their satisfaction. We want to create a community of active users who love our products, and are part of our development as a company and as a service, providing feedback and knowing they will always have a voice, that they are respected and that their insight is greatly appreciated. Some of the most successful companies in the world have growth that way, and pleasing your customers and active users is the best way to create engagement and an honest desire to remain visiting your site. We donâ€™t want to be one of those services that you visited once and then you never come back. We want to become the primary option for our users, regardless what their business or purpose is for those images. </p>
