              <p>Everything began with our founder, Angel Manzano, when he was trying to find images for a youtube video. He was having a hard time to find stock images that capture what he was trying to express, so he decided to go take his own photos. Eventually, he'd have a wide range of images for every situation, and that's what we are sharing with you.</p>

      <h2>Additional information about the website</h2>
      <h2>Where the idea came from?</h2>
<p>While checking other stock images websites, I noticed that despite they offering a wide variety of images from different topics, whether real life images, compositions or drawings, they have lack of creativity and originality when it comes to present images, some of them are even obsolete, showing technology or furniture that is no longer used, or inaccurate images to represent something not the way it should be portrayed, for example, when you search an image about coding, you will always get that laptop photo with a bunch of Binary code in it, but honestly how much people program in Binary or even know how it works? Very little. Part of our service is to ensure people get images that truly represent their ideas the way they conceived them, in a way that is true to the topic or what they want to transmit to their audience. </p> 
<h2>The purpose</h2>
<p> The purpose of Stockpics is to provide an alternative for stock images that can be used for any situation, Business, School, Personal projects, illustrations, books, articles, videos, etc. Our objective demographic can be quite extense, therefore we strive to provide images that are current, meaningful and represent what our users want to portray through them.  </p>
<h2>Users expectations</h2>
<p> Our visitors can expect us to be completely focused on their satisfaction. We want to create a community of active users who love our products, and are part of our development as a company and as a service, providing feedback and knowing they will always have a voice, that they are respected and that their insight is greatly appreciated. Some of the most successful companies in the world have growth that way, and pleasing your customers and active users is the best way to create engagement and an honest desire to remain visiting your site. We donâ€™t want to be one of those services that you visited once and then you never come back. We want to become the primary option for our users, regardless what their business or purpose is for those images. </p>
<p> We want our website to be welcoming, user-friendly and that the user can quickly find exactly what they are looking for. We will implement a sophisticated tagging process so that the images are shown accurately depending on the topic the user searches. We will offer some images that will be free, but the most specific topics will require either a one time purchase for the images or a monthly subscription for full access to it. 
Information required from our users</p>
<p> Users should be able to create an account with a personal email address, which will require their name and address. Just with that they will have access to the free tier. The user can simply type keywords that should return the images associated with them. Eventually users will be able to add a credit/debit card in order to have access to the paid tiers and the benefits of a monthly subscriptions. </p>
<h2>Overall goal</h2>
<p> Overall, the main goal is that users can find everything they may need in one place. We want to make this a fun, engaging activity. We will rely heavily on customerâ€™s feedback and request to make improvements to the website and to the content. We will work non-stop to achieve those goals. Ahead of us are several sleepless nights and hours of content designing and organizing, but it will all be worth it in the end.</p>
